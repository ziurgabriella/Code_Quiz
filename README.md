As you progress towards becoming a full-stack web developer, it's probable that you'll encounter a coding assessment as part of an interview process. These assessments usually consist of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. To help you prepare for such tests and apply the skills taught in this module, our client is requesting that you create a timed coding quiz that features multiple-choice questions, runs on a browser, and utilizes JavaScript code to dynamically update the HTML and CSS for a visually appealing, polished, and responsive user interface.
